Project 2 
#Dashboard of economic sentiment on different asset classes

This project allows us to make future predictions of the value of various assets using historical data, media setiment and the power of machine learning. We can use these predictions to follow market trends and to anticipate asset values. After gathering data from various sources, we cleaned and processed this data for processing by our NLP and Machine Learning algorithims. After processing, we visualized the data and our predictions for analysis and presentation.  

#	Data sources
For our data, we used various sources such as ALPACA and Yahoo Finance. We used these sources to extrapolate key metrics such as:
-	Crypto Currency prices (BitCoin and Ethereum) 
-	Stock Market closing prices
-	Crude Oil prices 
-	Gold prices 


 # Deliverables:

We aim to provide a standard analysis and to display key metrics. To do so, we will use natural language processing (NLP) to run a sentiment analysis on key words involved with the asset classes chosen. This will provide us with output word counts and positive, neutral or negative sentiments associated with each asset. Our machine learning component will classify the sentiment data (positive, neutral, negative) and calculate a future prediction of sentiment.

Our deliverables include:
-	NLP sentiment scores (mark Staten)
-	An interactive dashboard (Mark Staten)
-	A Machine Learning predictive algorithim (Jacob Edelbrock)
-	Asset class and predicted values data frames and visualizations (Gerald Howard and Jacob Edelbrock)
-	Power point presentation (Gerald Howard)
-	Read Me file (Gerald Howard)
